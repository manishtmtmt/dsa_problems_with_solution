## **Apply Basic Maths**

You are given an array `A` with `N` elements. You are allowed to `remove only one element`, which makes the `sum of all the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7`.

Your task is to find the `first of smallest element` that can be removed from array. If there is no answer print `-1`.

#### **Sample Input**
    input:  5
            14 7 8 2 4

#### **Sample Output**
    output:  1

#### **Constraints**
    1 <= N <= 100000
    0 < A[k] < 1000000000
