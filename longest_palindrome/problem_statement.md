## **Longest Palindrome**

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

#### **Sample Input**
    input: s = "abccccdd"

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 7

#### **Explanation**
    One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

#### **Constraints**
    1 <= s.length <= 2000
    s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
