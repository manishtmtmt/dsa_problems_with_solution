## **Such Pair Returns**

For each test case, you are given N integers and K, your task is to write a program that prints "1" (without quotes) if there are 2 integers present in the array whose sum is K. Else print "-1" (without quotes).

#### **Input Format**

- First line contains T, no of test cases.

- First line of each test case contains 2 space seperated integers: N & K

- Second line of each test case contains N space seperated integers.

#### **Output Format**

- Output 1/-1 depending on the condition for each test case on new line

#### **Sample Input**
    input: 1
           5 2
           3 4 0 2 7  

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 1

#### **Constraints**
    1 <= T <= 10
    1 <= N <= 1000000
