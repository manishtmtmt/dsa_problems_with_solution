## **Alternate Palindrome**

Given a string s of length n, find out if it's possible to make it palindrome by rearranging their characters.

Print "Yes" if it is possible else "No" (without quotes).

#### **Input Format**

- The first line of the input contains one integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

- The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, the length of the string.

- The second line of each test case contains the string s.

#### **Output Format**

- For each test case, print the answer: Yes or No.

#### **Sample Input**
    input: 3
           1 
           a
           3
           aab
           4
           abbb 

#### **Sample Output**
    output: Yes
            Yes
            No

#### **Constraints**
     1 <= t <= 1000
    1 <= n <= 1000
