## **Vowels in Rows**

-  You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the name `N` and `M`

- The value stored in `N` denotes the number of rows, and the value in `M` denotes the number of columns

- The 2D array is stored in a variable with the name `arr`, and contains lower case English characters

- You have to print `Yes`, if any particular row of a 2D array contains at least one vowel, at least print `No`.


#### **Input Format**

- The first line of the input contains the value stored in `N` and `M`

- The next `N` lines contain `M` values each denoting the value stored in `arr`

#### **Output Format**

- For each row, print `Yes`, if the row contains at least one vowel, otherwise print `No`
