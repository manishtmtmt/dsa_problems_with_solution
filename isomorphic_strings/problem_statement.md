## **Isomorphic Strings**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

#### **Sample Input**
    input: s = "egg", t = "add"

#### **Sample Output**
    output: true

#### **Constraints**
    1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
    t.length == s.length
    s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
