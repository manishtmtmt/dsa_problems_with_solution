## **Merge Two Sorted Lists**

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

#### **Sample Input**
    input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]

#### **Sample Output**
    output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

#### **Constraints**
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
