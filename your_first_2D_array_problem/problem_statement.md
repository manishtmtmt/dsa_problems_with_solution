## **Your first 2D Array Problem**

- You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the name `N` and `M`.

- The value stored in `N` denotes the number of rows, and the value in `M` denotes the number of columns

- The 2D array is stored in a variable with the name `arr`

- You have to print the elements of the 2D array, row by row

- For example, consider the value in `N = 3`, `M = 2` and the array is `arr = [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]`, then the required output will be
#
    1 2
    3 4
    5 6

#### **Sample Input**
    input:  3 2
            1 2
            3 4
            5 6

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 1 2
            3 4
            5 6
