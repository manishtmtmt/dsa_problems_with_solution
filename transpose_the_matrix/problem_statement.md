#### **Input Format**

- First line contains two integers n and m.

- Next n lines contain m integers which represents each row of 2D array

#### **Output Format**

- Print the transposed array

#### **Sample Input**
    input:  5 4
            0 0 0 0
            1 1 1 1
            2 2 2 2
            3 3 3 3
            4 4 4 4

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 0 1 2 3 4
            0 1 2 3 4
            0 1 2 3 4
            0 1 2 3 4

#### **Constraints**
