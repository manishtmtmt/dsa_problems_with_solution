## **Average-of-all**

You are given an `arr` which has `N` integers.

Write a program to print the ceil of `average of integers` present in the array.

**Note:-** The ceil value of the given number `K` is the smallest integer value greater or equal to a `K`.

For example:-

1. if the value of K = 3.679, the ceil value of K is 4
2. if the value of K = 5, the ceil value of K is 5.
