## **Perform Merging**

You are given two sorted arrays each of length N. Your task is to write a program that merges both the arrays such that the final array formed after merging is sorted.

Note: You must not use sort() function in your entire code

#### **Input Format**

- First line contains N which is the number of integers present in both the arrays.

- Second line contains N sorted integers which are elements of first array.

- Third line contains N sorted integers which are elements of second array.

#### **Output Format**

- Output the array formed after merging elements such that it is sorted

#### **Sample Input**
    input: 4 
           1 5 7 9
           2 4 6 8 

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9

#### **Constraints**
     N < 1000
