## **Rotate By 90**

Given a square `matrix` of size `N`, turn it by 90 degress in an anti-clockwise direction, as shown in sample input

#### **Input Format**

- First line will contain the number of rows N (same as the number of columns)

After that next N lines will N rows of the matrix.

#### **Output Format**

- You have to display the `rotated matrix`.

#### **Sample Input**
    input:  4
            1 2 3 4
            5 6 7 8
            1 2 3 4
            5 6 7 8

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 4 8 4 8
            3 7 3 7
            2 6 2 6
            1 5 1 5

#### **Constraints**
    1 <= N <= 1000
    1 <= Element of the matrix <= 10000
