## **Feel Good Strings**

Tom loves vowels. Any string which have half of the characters vowels make him feel good. You are given a string of length N, where N is an even number. If the number of vowels in the string, are more than or equal to N/2, print `Feel good!`, else print `Feel bad!`. (All the letters in the string are lower case).

Note: The letters a, e, i, o, and u are said to be vowels.
