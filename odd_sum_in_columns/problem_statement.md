## **Even Sum in Columns**

-  You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the name `N` and `M`

- The value stored in `N` denotes the number of rows, and the value in `M` denotes the number of columns

- The 2D array is stored in a variable with the name `arr`

- For all columns, you have to print the sum of odd elements present in the column

#### **Input Format**

- The first line of the input contains the value stored in `N` and `M`

- The next `N` lines contain `M` values each denoting the value stored in `arr`

#### **Output Format**

- For each column, print the sum of odd numbers present in the column, line by line

#### **Sample Input**
