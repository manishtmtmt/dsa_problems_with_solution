## **Detect Palindrome**

You are given an integer `num`.

You need to print `Yes` if that integer is a palindrome or else print `No`.

A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, such as `madam` or `racecar`.

#### **Sample Input**
    input: 1221

#### **Sample Output**
    output: Yes

#### **Constraints**
    1 <= num <= 1000000
