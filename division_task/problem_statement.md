## **Division Task**

You are given a number N.

Let's say you derive a variable x which is equal to the floor of a number you get when 32 is divided by N.

- In case x is 0, print Too Low
- In case is not possible to generate a valid number, print -1
- In all other case, print x.

#### **Sample Input**
    input: 4

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 8

#### **Constraints**
    N <= 100

#### **Output**
Output string or number based on the conditions mentioned above

#### **Hint**
When 32 is divided by 4 answer is 8. Floor value of 8 is 8. So x is 8.

As per our conditions we need to print the number itself, so we print 8.
