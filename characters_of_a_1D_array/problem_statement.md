## **Characters of a 1D Array**

- You are given a string, whose size is stored in a variable with the name `N`

- The string is stored in a variable with the name `N`

- Each element of the string contains one of these symbols - `'*', '-', '/'`

- The symbols represent the following values

- `8 -> 0`
- `- -> 1`
- `/ -> 2`

- You have to generate a string, such that each symbol is replaced by its corresponding values

- For example, consider the value stored in `N = 5`, and the value stored in `str = */-*/`

- Therefore, replacing each value with it's corresponding value, we get `02102`, which is the required answer

#### **Sample Input**
    input: 5
           */-*/ 

#### **Sample Output**
    output: 02102
